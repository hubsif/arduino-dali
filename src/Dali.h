/**
 * @mainpage
 * This library allows you to create a DALI controller/gateway with an Arduino device.
 * It supports sending commands, receiving responses and commissioning devices.
 * It requires the TimerOne library for transmission and the PinChangeInterrupt library
 * for reception. These libraries need to be installed with the Library Manager in the
 * Arduino IDE.
 *
 * @par Simple example
 * @include dali_blink.ino
 *
 * @par Changelog
 * - v0.0.3 (2022-09-19) Make commissioning state public
 * - v0.0.2 (2019-05-14) Initial release
 *
 * @author hubsif <hubsif@gmx.de>
